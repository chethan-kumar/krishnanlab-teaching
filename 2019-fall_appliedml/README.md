## Description
This course focuses on ML as applied to the physical and life sciences, with a focus on science-constrained ML. The use of ML in the context of modeling systems taken from biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering will be emphasized in the following manner: each set of ML topics will be motivated by specific problems in one of these areas and the discussion will take students through problem formulation, solution, analysis, communication, limitations and open questions in using ML to solve those problems.

Students will learn how to formulate their scientific problems for solving them using ML, design the ML project, explore data, evaluate and select models, communicate research findings, perform reproducible research, and practice open science. Students will apply all these by carrying out a class project, presenting their project in class, and submit a report at the end of the course.

**Note**  
Open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Counts toward the CMSE minor, graduate certificates, and dual PhD. Please email Heather Johnson at john1451@msu.edu for an override.

**Prerequisites**  
* CMSE 201 or CMSE 301-304 or equivalent with Python programming experience.  
* Introductory statistics at the level of STT 231 is strongly recommended.  
* Advanced courses in a science discipline.

Basically, it would be assumed that you:
- know how to code in Python,
- have an understanding of basic statistics and probability, and
- are engaged in research in the physical or life sciences.

We will block this time from our schedules and be present in our offices.

Couple of things to note:
1. While we are happy to chat with you in person, many times, just sending one of us a message on Slack with your questions/concerns might work as well. So, if you have specific Qs in mind, just shoot one of us a message and let's see if we can resolve it then and there.
2. If you would indeed like to meet in person, please try to meet one of us during this time. But, don't worry if you can't make it during this window for some reason. Again, just send us a message on Slack and we'll find a time that works for both of us.

## Course Activities

### Pre-class Assignments
TBD

### Class Participation
In general:
- Do the pre-class assignments and additional readings.
- Show up to class.
- Work in groups during in-class discussion sessions.
- No one will have the perfect background: **Ask questions** about computational, programming, or scientific concepts.
- Correct us when we are wrong or when you have a better suggestion about anything.

#### Paper discussion
TBD

### Scribing
Each class will have two dedicated scribes who will take notes on the lecture, work with Arjun & Michael to refine the notes, and circulate a final version to the rest of the class.
- The scribes should submit their _individually completed_ drafts of their scribe notes within 3 days after lecture. I will read those notes and give comments/suggestions.
- The two scribes should then work together to combine their drafts+comments into a single final scribe notes and submit within 6 days after lecture.

### Semester Project and Presentation
A major goal of this course is to prepare you for performing original scientific research using machine learning, and for effectively presenting your ideas and results. The semester project will serve as the most practical way to do exactly that.

Projects can take any one of the following flavors:
- Design and implement a new ML approach for a scientific question of interest
- Improve an existing ML apporach
- Perform an evaluation of several existing methods
- Develop a fully-reproducible documentation and codebase for an existing analysis in a paper

The outcomes of this semester-long project should include:
1. Well-documented code to:
    - download and process the data
    - perform the computational analysis and generate all the results
    - visualize the results as various plots
2. Detailed final report containing the following sections:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Data and Methods
    - Results and Discussion
    - Limitations and Future Directions
    - References
3. A poster that describes your project - motivation, exact problem, approach, results, discussion & conclusions, limitations & future directions, and acknowledgements/references.

There are several [project deadlines](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/tree/master/2019-fall_appliedml#project-deadlines) throughout the course that will help you stay on track, allowing you to complete a substantial project.
1. Describe your previous research, areas of research interest in machine learning, and the type of project that best fits your interests. Post this description in a profile that lets your classmates know you. **TBD**
2. Discuss with Michael/Arjun (and any other PI) and read recent papers. Describe project ideas. **TBD**
3. Prepare a two-page pre-proposal (Page1: text; Page2: figures & references). **TBD**
4. Write 4-page proposal describing project goals, division of work, milestones, datasets, and challenges. **TBD**
5. Review and discuss proposals (NIH review format). **TBD**
6. Address peer evaluations, revise aims, scope, list of final goals & deliverables. **TBD** (note: due after presentation).
7. Continue making substantial progress on proposed milestones. Write outline/first-draft of final report. Meet Arjun to discuss all results and get feedback on the draft. **TBD**
8. Complete milestones, finalize results, figures, write-up in conference publication format. As part of the report, comment on your overall project experience. **TBD**
9. Final project presentations will take place on **TBD**.

## Attendance, Conduct, Honesty, and Accommodations

### Class Attendance
This class is heavily based on material presented and worked on in class, and it is critical that you attend and participate fully every week! Therefore, class attendance is absolutely required. An unexcused absence will result in zero points for the day. Arriving late or leaving early without prior arrangement with the instructor of your session counts as an unexcused absence. Note that if you have a legitimate reason to miss class (such as job, graduate school, or medical school interviews), you must arrange this ahead of time to be excused from class. Three unexcused absences will result in the reduction of your grade by one step (e.g., from 4.0 to 3.5), with additional absences reducing your grade further at the discretion of the course instructor.

### Code of Conduct
All conduct should serve the singular goal of sustain a friendly, supportive, and fun environment where we can do our best work and have a great time doing it.
* Do work that you’re proud of, from the smallest piece of code to the entire project.
* Be supportive of your classmates; respect each others' strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs.
* Communicate openly & respectfully with everyone in the class.
* Ask for help; at the same time, respect and appreciate others' time and effort.

Respectful and responsible behavior is expected at all times, which includes not interrupting other students, turning your cell phone off, refraining from non-course-related use of electronic devices, and not using offensive or demeaning language in our discussions. Flagrant or repeated violations of this expectation may result in ejection from the classroom, grade-related penalties, and/or involvement of the university Ombudsperson.

I am unequivocally dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We will not tolerate harassment of colleagues in any form. Behaviors that could be considered discriminatory or harassing, or unwanted sexual attention, will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the appropriate MSU office (which may include the MSU Police Department).

### Academic honesty
Intellectual integrity is the foundation of the scientific enterprise. In all instances, you must do your own work and give proper credit to all sources that you use in your papers and oral presentations – any instance of submitting another person's work, ideas, or wording as your own counts as plagiarism. This includes failing to cite any direct quotations in your essays, research paper, class debate, or written presentation. The MSU College of Natural Science adheres to the policies of academic honesty as specified in the General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University statement on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who plagiarize will receive a 0.0 in the course. In addition, University policy requires that any cheating offense, regardless of the magnitude of the infraction or punishment decided upon by the professor, be reported immediately to the dean of the student's college.

It is important to note that **plagiarism in the context of this course includes, but is not limited to**, directly copying another student's solutions to in-class or homework problems; copying materials from online sources, textbooks, or other reference materials without citing those references in your source code or documentation, or having somebody else do your pre-class work, in-class work, or homework on your behalf. Any work that is done in collaboration with other students should state this explicitly, and have their names as well as yours listed clearly.

More broadly, we ask that students adhere to the Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge, as written by the Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU): "As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do."

### Accomodations
If you have a university-documented learning difficulty or require other accommodations, please provide me with your VISA as soon as possible and speak with me about how I can assist you in your learning.  If you do not have a VISA but have been documented with a learning difficulty or other problems for which you may still require accommodation, please contact MSU’s Resource Center for People with Disabilities (355-9642) in order to acquire current documentation.
